8. UI/UX PRINCIPLES
================================================================================

DESIGN PHILOSOPHY
-----------------
- Simple over feature-rich

- Mobile over desktop

VISUAL STYLE
------------

- Generous whitespace
- Clear typography
- Subtle colors, not overwhelming
- No dark patterns or manipulative UI

INTERACTION PATTERNS
--------------------
- One primary action per screen
- Clear feedback on all actions
- Forgiving - easy to undo/change
- Progressive disclosure - show more only when needed

MOBILE CONSIDERATIONS
---------------------
- Thumb-friendly tap targets (min 44px)
- Bottom navigation for primary actions
- Swipe gestures where natural
- Offline-capable for viewing schedule

================================================================================
9. LAUNCH STRATEGY
================================================================================

PHASE 1: Closed Beta (Invite Only)
----------------------------------
- Hand-picked early users (10-20)
- Direct feedback channel
- Rapid iteration
- No public marketing

PHASE 2: Private Beta (Waitlist)
--------------------------------
- Waitlist signup on landing page
- Gradual invite rollout
- Monitor system stability
- Gather testimonials

PHASE 3: Public Launch
----------------------
- Remove invite requirement
- Public marketing
- Free tier available to all

================================================================================
10. SUCCESS METRICS
================================================================================

MVP SUCCESS CRITERIA
--------------------
- 100 active businesses in first 3 months
- 1000 bookings processed
- <5% support ticket rate
- >80% 7-day retention

KEY METRICS TO TRACK
--------------------
- Signups (daily/weekly/monthly)
- Active businesses (made booking in last 30 days)
- Bookings per business
- Booking completion rate
- Time to first booking (onboarding speed)
- Churn rate

================================================================================
11. RISKS & MITIGATIONS
================================================================================

RISK: Email deliverability
- Bookings fail if emails don't arrive
- MITIGATION: Use reputable provider (Resend), warm up domain, monitor bounces

RISK: No-shows / spam bookings
- Fake bookings waste owner time
- MITIGATION: Email verification for customers, rate limiting, future: deposits

RISK: Timezone confusion
- Wrong appointment times
- MITIGATION: Clear timezone display, store all times in UTC, convert for display

RISK: Mobile-only limits growth
- Some users prefer desktop
- MITIGATION: Ensure responsive works on desktop, prioritize but don't block
